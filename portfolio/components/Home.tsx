      <p>Welcome to my website! This site was created to act as a showcase of my web programming abilities, as well as provide links to several external websites and applications which I have created as part of my software development portfolio.</p>
      <p>My interest in the Tech industry comes from an enjoyment of using deductive processes to find solutions to problems and creating applications which cater to a clientâ€™s needs. This year I undertook a software development bootcamp with Northcoders, where I learned valuable skills relating to industry practices. As somebody with experience in working with a variety of programming languages, as well as a Computer Science background, I am interested in gaining a position in a professional software development role in order to further my programming career.</p>
