      <h3>Hobbies/Interests</h3>
      <p>I love music, and have taught myself to play bass guitar using books and online tutorials. I play in a band, which has helped to improve my teamwork, creativity and coordination skills. Some of my favourite bands include The Cure, The Smiths, Queen, Led Zeppelin, Nirvana and Alice in Chains.</p>
