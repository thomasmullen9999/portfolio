      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>My interest in the Tech industry comes from an enjoyment of using deductive processes to find solutions to problems and creating applications which cater to a clientâ€™s needs. This year I undertook a software development bootcamp with Northcoders, where I learned valuable skills relating to industry practices. As somebody with experience in working with a variety of programming languages, as well as a background in computer science, I am interested in gaining a position in a professional software development role in order to further my programming career.</p>

      <h3>Hobbies/Interests</h3>
      <p>I love music, and have taught myself to play bass guitar using books and online tutorials. I play in a band, which has helped to improve my teamwork, creativity and coordination skills. Some of my favourite bands include The Cure, The Smiths, Queen, Led Zeppelin, Nirvana and Alice in Chains.</p>
