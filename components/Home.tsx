This site was created to act as a showcase of my web programming abilities, as well as provide links to several external websites and applications which I have created as part of my software development portfolio. Several of these projects were created whilst studying at a bootcamp or completing online courses, while others were created in my own personal time as an attempt to continue to hone my coding knowledge and broaden my skillset as a dev.</p>
