      <p>Welcome to my website! This site was created to act as a showcase of my web programming abilities, as well as provide links to several external websites and applications which I have created as part of my software development portfolio. Several of these projects were created whilst studying at a bootcamp or completing online courses, while others were created in my own personal time as an attempt to continue to hone my coding knowledge and broaden my skillset as a dev.</p>
      <p>My interest in the Tech industry comes from an enjoyment of using deductive processes to find solutions to problems and creating applications which cater to a clientâ€™s needs. This year I undertook a software development bootcamp with Northcoders, where I learned valuable skills relating to industry practices. As somebody with experience in working with a variety of programming languages, as well as a Computer Science background, I am interested in gaining a position in a professional software development role in order to further my programming career.</p>
      <p>The <em>Skills</em> section displays a list of technical skills I am proficient in (languages, frameworks, etc.), whilst the <em>Certifications</em> section contains a selection of awards I have achieved in some relevant courses. The actual list of projects I have worked on can be found in the <em>Portfolio</em> section.</p>
